      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a registered nurse, going on 9 years, working at St Joseph Hospital in the endoscopy department in 
        Bellingham. I've also worked at Swedish Medical Center at their Seattle and Issaquah campuses, in the operating room 
        and also endoscopy. While I've enjoyed nursing, it is a incredibly demanding and draining job, so I'm looking for a 
        career change into something a little different, or in this case A LOT different.
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I've been a Washingtonian since I was a year old, growing up in the PNW. I'm Peruvian on my mom's side and
        American on my dad's.
      </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Sleeping is high up on the list but also hiking, playing crappy guitar, singing, Friends and The Office, and cuddling
        with my cats.
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Anything with animals, but an underwater photographer/videographer would be awesome!</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Burlington, WA -about an hour north of Seattle</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I love anything involving design so front end web development sounds right up my alley. Outside of the medical
        profession computers seem to be where it's at and there's a lot of opportunity for growth in the field.
